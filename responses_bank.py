An average Supard lives for 500~1000 years, so Ruijerd likely wasn't even born during that period.","Ruijerd has only been confirmed to serve during the 3rd Human-Demon War (aka Laplace's War). He was one of the most important figures during the war, his efforts shaping the current landscape of the world."],
      ["When he first started learning magic at the age of 2, Rudeus quickly blew past the intermediate stage for almost all schools of magic because of his innate understanding of physics and science.","The magic spells Rudeus used at the age of 3~4 were of this tier. Most of his other schools of magic remain at this tier way long pass his days adventuring in the Demon Continent.", "That's right. Rudeus reached Saint tier at the age of 5.

Wayyy better than Pax.","The 4th prince had his head ripped apart by Zanoba shortly after he was born \n(by accident of course !). Too bad it wasn't Pax instead....","Right.

Unfortunately, their isolation with the surrounding demonic kingdoms and distance from other human nations makes their economy fall short.","The Kingdom of the Dragon King is a fast growing nation, recently subjugating many nearby smaller nations. Though they still don't have nearly enough military might to take on great nations like Asura or Holy Milis, frailer nations such as Shirone fall within the threat of their blades.","In terms of magic prowess, the Three Magic Nation Alliance are definitely the pinacle of the world. Though, their efforts are mainly directed towards the progression of magical advancements within society, which leaves them little concern with political or military issues."],
      ["Monsters aren't a race, do you consider animals a race ? And 'Gods' are ranks or titles, they aren't a seperate group of races.","Both elves and dwarfs fall under the category of Beastfolk. This is because the proximity of beastfolk and demon races across hundreds of centuries have led to a variety of new sub-races, which include elves(mainly beastfolk), dwarfs(mainly beastfolk), ogres(mainly demon race), etc.","You got it right ! Both mermaids and angels exist in Mushoku Tensei's world, though it's not likely you'll see any characters from these two races anytime soon (they're VERY seclutive !)."],

Was the 'Dragon' part not clear enough ?","Right, at this point in time, Sword God Gal Farion is the only pure human that made it into the ranks of the 'Seven Great Powers'.

However, she is not particularly strong when it comes to combat strength (quite the opposite in fact).", "The strength of Saint Milis is undefined. It's said that the entirety of Saint Milis road was created with a single swing of his holy blade.

As a human, it would be unbeliveble for him to survive up till this point in time.", "Ars, if he really existed, is likely the strongest human in the history of the world.

      ["You'd be right if the question was the other way around.","Nope, try again.","The Demon Continent is the poorest and most inhospitable place to live. Their money isn't worth a 1 to 1 exchange with Asura, the richest nation in the world.","That's right ! It takes about a hundred Green Ore coins to reach the value of 1 Asuran Gold Coin. Fun fact, the official checkpoint charges around 200 Green ore coins for a Supard to cross into Milis Continent's Zanto port. They really don't like the Demon race, especially Supards !"],
      ["Although Perugius was alive during this point in time, he was just a child and did not play a role in the Dragon God's terror.","You forgot the part where he mastered Sage Mode and found the One Piece too.","That's right, out of the 7 heroes that defeated Demon God Laplace, Perugius is the most famous of them all.\n\nHe displayed the magnificence of his powers throughout the war against Laplace. Perugius made use of his greatest strength, summoning magic, to call forth twelve familiars: Void, Dark, Bright, Surge, Life, Violent Earthquake, Time, Roaring Thunder, Destruction, Insight, Insanity, and Atonement. These were the aliases of his strongest familiars.\n\nWith them by his side, Perugius restored the old floating fortress [Chaos Breaker] and headed into the final battle against Laplace.\n\nYet all that power was not enough to completely destroy the Demon God, forcing Perugius to settle for sealing him away instead.\n\nWith the end of that war, humanity proclaimed the start of a new era. Which is the current era, the Armored Dragon Era, named after him for his great service to the world.","I believe you're thinking of Death God Randolph. By the way, his fried chicken absolutely sucked ! Rudeus said so himself."],
      ["With it's rich peaceful farmlands and relatively weak monsters, the Central continent is in fact the safest continent to live in.","The Begaritt Continent houses extremely violent monsters, and is where the most infamous dungeons in the world can be found. However, it is not the most dangerous continent.","Although the path to reach the Heavon continent is full of strive and dangers, the continent itself is mostly peaceful. Though not much is known about it.","Correct. In the Demon Continent, D-rank monsters and above are a common sight to see roaming around the outskirts of towns and cities. Many warriors travel to the Demon continent to train, but most never come back. It is an exceedingly harsh land ruled by a number of minor warring Demon Lords.\n\nThe worst thing that could happen is suddenly finding yourself stuck there. But what are the chances of that happening ?"],
      ["Exactly. True to its name, the Teleportation Labyrinth is full of near-undetectable teleportation traps that could completely destroy a party's formation. In worst cases, the teleported person could find themselves face-first with a horde of hungry monsters. Yikes !","Although a hydra may or may not actually be within its depths, that is not the reason why people consider this dungeon dangerous.","All dungeons have bloodthirsty monsters which evolved from the dense concentration of mana, it doesn't make it particularly dangerous though.","Although on the same continent, the empire of human-sized ants is not close to the Teleportation Labyrinth. They aren't as dangerous either since they're being sealed within four magic barriers created by a certain Dragon God."],
      ["It sounded that believable huh ?","Strive to get the answer right the next time !","That's right ! The Strife Zone constantly sees the rise and fall of dozens of small nations within even a single decade. Although the conflicts may not be large-scale, the sheer number of them have led people to call it as such.","I believe places with fighting Demon Lords are simply called a war zones :)"],
      ["Zenith became very adept at healing magic before her adventuring days, but she wasn't famous nor did she make a living from it. ","Zenith seems to be good with kids, she probably would have made a good school teacher.","She may give off that impression sometimes, but that just isn't the truth.","That's right ! Zenith was the second daughter of a noble count family within the Holy Milis Kingdom. She learned healing magic because it was part of her education as a noble lady. She ran away from home at the age of fifteen after a fight with her parents, and became an adventurer soon after. Pretty similar to Paul, I would say."],
      ["Bofa DEEZ NUTZ ! HAH ! Got eem!","There aren't any known dragons in the Demon Continent. It's filled with other scary monsters though.","All Supard are born with a three-pointed tail. It grows with them until they reached a certain age, at which point it would stiffen up and fall off. Yet even when separated, it's somehow part of their body. The more they use it, the sharper and more deadly it would grow. With enough time and effort, these tridents could become peerless weapons, virtually unbreakable and capable of piercing through pretty much anything. Supards usually never cast aside their spears, not until the day they die.","A spear passed down through history would probably break easily though ? No ?"],
      ["Maybe in other series. But nothing can restore a life that's over in Mushoku Tensei. Even immortal beings would not be able to revive if they truly lost their lives.","That's right. Not even God-tier healing magic can bring back a lost life.\nBut it CAN save those whose bodies are being destroyed.\n\nAn example would be God-Tier magic may be used to completely stop the Magic Stone Disease, which is an uncurable disease that slowly turns the infected person's body to rock hard granite."],
      ["That's right. They were a solid adventuring party consisting of Zenith the healer, Ghylaine the frontline, Paul the midguard, Elinalize the tank, Talhand the magician, and Geese the 'all-around handyman'","Paul's ego is big, but not THAT big... probably.","Paul created the 'Fittoa Search and Rescue' team after the Teleportation incident, its not the name of his party during his adventuring days.","Steppe Ladder is a famous S ranked party during Rudeus's adventuring days, not Paul's."],
      ["She's close to the person called 'Mad Dog', but it's not her.","'Mad Sword King' is held by another familiar character in the series, but not Ghyslaine.","Correct ! Ghyslaine got this nickname after she helped a struggling nation within the Strife Zone during the Teleportation incident. With her efforts during a hopeless battle against 2 larger nations, she helped them earn a decisive victory.\n\nAt the time, she did not give her name, so the soldiers called her 'The Forest Goddess'. Her mystic figure was passed down through the nation's history and culture. \n\nEven hundreds of years later, 'The Forest Goddess' remains a prominent symbol of hope for that nation's people. Though, Ghyslaine herself will never know this.","She's actually also known as 'Black Wolf Sword King', but not 'Black Fang Sword King'."],
